                <h3>Track Details</h3>
                <p>Pouto is a small, rural settlement located on the Pouto Peninsula in Northland, New Zealand, at the southern entrance of the Kaipara Harbour. The area is known for its rugged natural beauty, including extensive sand dunes, serene beaches, and dramatic coastal landscapes. Pouto is steeped in maritime history, with many shipwrecks off its coast, particularly around the notorious Pouto Point.

                    <br><br>Access to Pouto often involves a 4WD journey, particularly if you plan to explore beyond the main roads and reach more remote areas such as Pouto Point or the Pouto Lighthouse. The 4WD tracks in this region can be challenging, with soft sand, tidal flats, and rugged terrain. These tracks provide an adventurous route through the peninsulaâ€™s scenic landscapes, including access to isolated beaches and historical sites. 
                    
                    <br><br>Pouto offers a peaceful retreat for those seeking to escape the hustle and bustle, with activities such as fishing, beachcombing, and exploring the rich history and natural beauty of the area. Visitors should be well-prepared, as amenities are limited, and the remote nature of the area requires self-sufficiency.</p>
