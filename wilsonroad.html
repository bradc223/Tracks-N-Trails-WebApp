                 <h3>Track Details</h3>
                 <p>Wilson Road in South Head, located in the Kaipara region of New Zealand, is known for its scenic 4WD track that leads to a remote stretch of beach along the Kaipara Harbour. This area is popular with off-road enthusiasts and those seeking a more isolated beach experience.

                    The 4WD track off Wilson Road provides access through a combination of farmland and native bush before reaching the beach. The track can be challenging, with rough terrain, steep sections, and sometimes muddy conditions, making it suitable for experienced drivers with well-equipped vehicles. <br><br> The journey offers stunning views and a sense of adventure, but it's important to note that drivers should be mindful of the environmental impact. As with all 4WD tracks, safety precautions and proper preparation are essential. The beginning of the track is located off the side of Wilson Road, and drivers should be wary of other vehicles at times.</p>
