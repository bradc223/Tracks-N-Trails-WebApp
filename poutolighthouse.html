                <p>Pouto Lighthouse is a historic landmark located at the northern tip of the Pouto Peninsula, where the Kaipara Harbour meets the Tasman Sea in New Zealand's Northland region. The lighthouse, built in 1884, is one of the country's oldest wooden lighthouses and played a crucial role in guiding ships through the treacherous waters of the Kaipara Harbour, which was once one of New Zealand's busiest ports.

                    <br> <br>The journey to Pouto Lighthouse is an adventure in itself, often involving a 4WD drive along the remote and scenic Pouto Peninsula. The track to the lighthouse can be challenging, with sandy and occasionally rough terrain, making it suitable for experienced off-road drivers. The lighthouse, perched on a windswept bluff, offers panoramic views of the surrounding coastline and the vast expanse of the Tasman Sea. The area is steeped in history, with remnants of shipwrecks and stories of maritime heritage adding to the allure of the site.
                    
                    <br> <br>Visitors to Pouto Lighthouse are rewarded with a unique blend of natural beauty, history, and adventure, making it a memorable destination for those willing to make the journey.</p>
