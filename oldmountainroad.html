                <h3>Track Details</h3>
                <p> Old Mountain Road is a scenic and historic route located in the Waikato region of New Zealand's North Island. The road winds through the rugged terrain of the Pirongia Mountain Range, offering stunning views of native forests and rolling hills. It was historically significant as one of the early routes used by settlers and travelers moving between the Waikato plains and the west coast.
                <br><br>Today, Old Mountain Road is popular among adventurers, cyclists, and hikers who are drawn to its challenging terrain and natural beauty. The road is mostly unsealed, adding to its rustic charm, and is less frequented, making it a peaceful alternative to more developed routes in the region. The area is also home to several walking tracks and reserves, allowing visitors to explore the rich biodiversity and historical landmarks that characterize this part of Waikato.
                <br><br>While the road can be navigated by vehicles, it's important to note that it can be narrow and winding, requiring careful driving, especially in adverse weather conditions. For those looking to experience a slice of New Zealand's natural and historical heritage, Old Mountain Road offers a unique journey through the heart of Waikato.</p>
