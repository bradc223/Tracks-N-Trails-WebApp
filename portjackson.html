                <h3>Track Details</h3>
                <p>The Port Jackson Track, located at the northern tip of New Zealand's Coromandel Peninsula, offers a rugged and scenic 4WD adventure. This track is known for its coastal views, winding through remote and hilly terrain that requires careful driving, particularly in wet conditions.

                    <br><br>The track features a mix of gravel roads, steep inclines, and tight corners. While the route can be navigated by a high-clearance 4WD vehicle, drivers should be prepared for sections that may become slippery or muddy after rainfall, making the track more challenging. The narrow paths and sharp bends demand attention, and it's advisable to have off-road driving experience before attempting this route.
                    
                    <br><br>Port Jackson Track is less challenging than some other 4WD tracks in New Zealand, but its remote location and stunning coastal scenery make it a rewarding drive for those looking to explore the more isolated parts of the Coromandel Peninsulaâ€‹
