                <h3>Track Details</h3>
                <p>Thompsons Track, located in the Bay of Plenty region of New Zealand, is a popular yet challenging route for 4WD enthusiasts. The track stretches from the eastern side near Katikati to the western side near Te Aroha, traversing the Kaimai Ranges. This track is known for its rough and steep terrain, making it suitable only for well-equipped 4WD vehicles.
                    
                    <br><br>The track features a mix of rocky surfaces, deep ruts, and muddy sections that can become particularly difficult after heavy rainfall. It is notorious for its challenging inclines, with some areas requiring careful navigation to avoid getting stuck or damaging your vehicle. Due to the track's difficulty, it's recommended to travel in a convoy with recovery gear, as some sections may be impassable without assistance.
                    
                    <br><br>Drivers should also be prepared for rapidly changing weather conditions, which can significantly impact the track's difficulty. Overall, Thompsons Track is a rewarding route for experienced off-road drivers seeking an adventure in rugged terrain.</p>
